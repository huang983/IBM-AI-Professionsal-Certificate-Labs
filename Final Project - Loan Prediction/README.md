# Library:
    1. sklearn
    2. pandas
    3. numpy
    4. matplotlib
    
## Load data from csv file
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('loan_train.csv')
```

## Preprocessing:
 ```python
    from sklearn import preprocessing
    X = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X).trasnform(X) 
```
## Split test and train
 ```python
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33)
```

## Approach 1: KNN Algorithm

- Classifying cases based on their similarity to other cases
- Cases near each other are said to be neighbors

```buildoutcfg
1. Pick a value for K
2. Calculate the distance of unknown case from all cases
3. Select the K-observations in the training data that are nearest to the unkown data point
4. Predict the response of the unkown data point using the most popular response value from the K-nearest neighbors
```

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn import metrics
neigh = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = best_k).fit(X_train,y_train)
yhat = neigh.predict(X_test)
```

## Approach 2: Decision Tree
```buildoutcfg
1. Each node corresponds to a test (category)
2. Each branch corresponds to a result of the test
3. Each leaf node assigns a classification
4. Steps to build a decision tree
    I. Choose an attribute from dataset
   II. Calculate the significance of attribute in splitting of data (more significance = more predictiveness, less impurity, lower entropy)
  III. Split data based on the value of the best attribute
   IV. Back to I
```
```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
DT_model = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion="entropy", max_depth = 4)
DT_model.fit(X_train,y_train)
yhat = DT_model.predict(X_test)
```

## Approach 3: Support Vector Machine
```buildoutcfg
1. Supervised algorithm that classifies cases by finding a separator
2. Mapping data into a high-dimensional feature space (kerneling)
3. Finding a separator
```

```python
from sklearn import svm
SVM_model = svm.SVC()
SVM_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
yhat = SVM_model.predict(X_test)
```
## Approach 4: Logistic Regression
    1. Binary data
    2. Probabilistic results
    3. Linearly separable data
    
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
LR_model = LogisticRegression(C=0.01).fit(X_train,y_train)
yhat = LR_model.predict(X_test)
```

## Evaluation Metrics
1. Jaccard index:
    * y: actual labels
    * yhat: predicted labels
    * Accuracy = intersection(y, y_hat) / union(y, y_hat)
        
2. Confusion matrix:
    * Binary matrix
    * TP, FN, FP, TN
    * True labels represented by rows
    * Predicted labels represented by columns
    * Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
    * Recall = TP / (TP + FN) 
    * F1-score = 2 * (prc * rec) / (prc + rec)
    
3. Log loss:
    * Performance of a classifier where the predicted output is a probability value between 0 and 1
